Considering this is my first ever blog post I don't have many expectations so whatever I write here it's almost a mind dump.

This post is mostly about learning. I have realized recently(more like a year ago), that the best way for me to learn is by doing.
I know this might sound stupid, but it's quite simple. Most of the knowledge that I managed to retain is more or less from doing projects.
At University I studied Applied Electronics, and while this is not longer my career path and I no longer use most of the knowledge, but
I can remember most of my projects and almost none of the theoretical things that I tried really hard to study. In some cases, the theory and the practice
were hand in hand which helped.

What I mean exactly is that each and every one of us should discover the way in which he/she can learn the best. This will not only facilitate learning, but once this knowledge of learning how to learn is gained, it offers a lot more freedom to the individual to discover by oneself new things.

Hope this is one of the many blog posts that are to come.

Have a nice day :)
